    <h2>F1 Teams</h2>
    <p>Although drivers get most of the glory, F1 is a team sport.  The teams are responsible for building a brand new car from scratch each year.  During the season the team collects data during every possible testing opportunity and uses that to continue developing the car throughout the season.  The teams must devise a strategy for the race to give the driver the best possible opportunity to win.  Often races are decided by tire or pit strategy, so the teams role is more important than many understand.</p>
