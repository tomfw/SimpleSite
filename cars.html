	<h2>F1 Cars</h2>
	<p>Modern F1 cars are extremely complex. They now face fuel restrictions so the cars must be fuel efficient and generate electric energy as well. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>F1 cars now carry large batteries and electric motors capable of generating about as much power as a typical road car.  They use this power to supplement their gasoline engine.
        </li>
		<li>In order to continue developing technology relevent to road cars, F1 imposed a fuel restriction of 100kg at each race.  Refueling is not allowed during the race, so teams must carefully monitor fuel use in addition to overtaking cars.
        </li>
		<li>Aerodynamic downforce has been reduced this year by restrictions on the size of different elements, especially the rear wing.  Despite the changes aerodynamics still play a huge role in Formula 1.  Teams bring new parts to races throughout the season and rely heavily on CFD and wind-tunnel testing.
        </li>
