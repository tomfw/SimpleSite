    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This year brought about many new changes to Formula 1, and there are still changes on the horizon</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Standing restarts will be used rather than safety car restarts.  This means a caution flag could dramatically alter the race results.</li>
        <li>The clause in the technical regulations banning coaching of drivers will be strictly enforced. This means drivers will be required to handle more of the car setup on their own during the race.</li>
        <li>Honda will join F1 next year as an engine supplier.  They have already agreed to supply engines for McLaren.</li>
        <li>Gene Haas will allegedly be entering the only American F1 team in 2016</li>
    </ul>
